# OBS_Scripts
Simple OBS python scripts with lots of comments for clueless script writers like myself

I came to programming OBS because I had a project producing videos and scenes for a live stream. With a good background in Python, but very little training in computer science, I found the obspython documentation, which was apparently written by C++ programmers, very hard to understand. So I started looking for examples. Unfortunately there aren't a ton of examples out there of the things I wanted to do (or at least I wasn't finding them if there were). Many of the examples I did find were part of someone else's project and did too many things for me to be able to understand what parts were essential for the simple task I needed to do at the moment. So I have created this repo as a place to put examples I create as I struggle to understand what i am doing. If you find them useful, I'd love to hear from you. If you find them buggy or inefficient, I'd love to hear from you, too. Finally, if you want to use these in your own projects, feel free. I have selected the MIT license for maximum flexibility.
